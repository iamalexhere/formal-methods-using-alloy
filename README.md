# Formal Modeling Problems & Solutions

This repository contains a collection of formal modeling problems and their solutions using Alloy Analyzer. These problems are part of my formal methods course (AIF233125) coursework.

## Problems & Solutions

### [Eight Queens Problem](eight-queen)
A classic constraint satisfaction problem where eight queens must be placed on a chessboard such that no queen threatens any other queen. The solution demonstrates:
- Board representation using integers
- Constraint modeling for valid positions
- Row, column, and diagonal conflict prevention

### [Murder in the Family](murder%20in%20the%20family)
A logic puzzle involving a family of four where one member murdered another, one witnessed the crime, and one was an accessory. The solution demonstrates:
- Family structure modeling
- Role assignments
- Complex conditional constraints
- Age and gender relationships

### [The Best Tennis Player](the%20best%20player)
A logical deduction problem about Mr. Scott's family (himself, his sister, his son, and his daughter) and their tennis playing abilities. The solution demonstrates:
- Family relationship modeling
- Skill level representation
- Twin relationship modeling
- Age and gender constraints
